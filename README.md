`git clone https://github.com/amLiux/BrainyBoard.git`

Then, navigate to the `BrainyBoard` directory and run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

## Usage
Before starting the chatbot, make sure to create a `.env` file by copying the `env.sample` file and filling in the appropriate values:

`cp env.sample .env`

The `.env` file contains environment variables that are necessary for the chatbot to function properly. Here are the environment variables that need to be filled in:


```bash
slack_token=<your_slack_bot_token>
signing_secret=<your_slack_signing_secret>
trello_token=<your_trello_token>
trello_api_key=<your_trello_api_key>
board_id=<your_trello_board_id>
slack_endpoint=<your_slack_endpoint>
destination_language=<your_destination_language>
openai_api_key=<your_openai_api_key>
```

- `slack_token`: The Slack API token for your bot user. You can find instructions on how to create a Slack bot and obtain its token in the [Slack documentation](https://api.slack.com/authentication/basics).

- `signing_secret`: The signing secret for your Slack bot. You can find instructions on how to obtain this secret in the [Slack documentation](https://api.slack.com/authentication/verifying-requests-from-slack).

- `trello_token`: The Trello API token for your account. You can generate a token by following the instructions in the [Trello documentation](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/trello/guides/rest-api/api-introduction/).

- `trello_api_key`: The Trello API key for your account. You can generate an API key by following the instructions in the [Trello documentation](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/trello/guides/rest-api/api-introduction/).

- `board_id`: The ID of the Trello board you want to access. You can find the ID in the board URL or by using the [Trello API](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/trello/rest/api-group-boards/).

- `slack_endpoint`: The Slack Events API endpoint for your bot. You can find instructions on how to set up this endpoint in the [Slack documentation](https://api.slack.com/events-api). Most of the times this is setup to `slack/events`

- `destination_language`: The language to translate the user's message to before sending it to the ChatGPT model. You can find a list of supported languages and their language codes in the [Google Cloud Translate documentation](https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/languages).

- `openai_api_key`: The API key for the OpenAI GPT-3 model. You can find instructions on how to obtain this key in the [OpenAI documentation](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/authentication).

To start the chatbot, run the following command in the `BrainyBoard` directory:
`python bot.py`

## Local Development

To test the chatbot locally, you will need to use a tool like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to expose your local server to the internet. 

### Steps:

1. Download and install ngrok by following the [instructions](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/setup).
2. Run the following command in your terminal to start the chatbot: `python main.py`
3. Start ngrok by running the following command in your terminal: `ngrok http 5000`
4. Copy the ngrok URL generated by the previous command and update the [Slack commands](https://api.slack.com/interactivity/slash-commands) with this URL. To do this, go to the Slack App Dashboard, select the slash command you want to update, and replace the Request URL with the ngrok URL.

Once you have updated the Slack commands, you can start testing the chatbot by typing the commands in your Slack channel. All requests to your ngrok URL will be forwarded to your local server running on port 5000.
